# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
PATH = "../input"

# Let's try to understand how to work with kaggle kernel
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


#Let's first explore then application train and import the data
# It takes time to importing the data because the adta set is large

previous_application = pd.read_csv(PATH+"/previous_application.csv")
POS_CASH_balance = pd.read_csv(PATH+"/POS_CASH_balance.csv")


# This task is very big. Let's use some giants shoulders to get things around and understand how to operate
# One thing to notice: you should write your code in a more readable way

#Let's try it out - the random forest algorithm 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier 
#Isolate Data, class labels and column values - it seems like not easy to do it. 












# With the consideration of the domain of loan industry, which features are the most important?
