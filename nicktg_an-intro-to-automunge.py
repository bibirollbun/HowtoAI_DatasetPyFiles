#trasnformdict and processdict are for more advanced users. They allow the user to design

#trasnformation functions into use on the platform. I won't go into full detail on these methods
#here, I documented these a bunch in the essays which I'll link to below, but here's a taste.

#Say that we have a numerical set that we want to use to apply multiple trasnformations. Let's just
#make a few up, say that we have a set with fat tail characteristics, and we want to do multiple
#trasnformions including a bocx-cox trasnformation, a z-score trasnformation on that output, as
#well as a set of bins for powers of 10. Well our 'TransactionAmt' column might be a good candiate
#for that. Let's show how.

#Here we define our cusotm trasnform dict using our "family tree primitives"
#Note that we always need to uyse at least one replacement primitive, if a column is intended to be left
#intact we can include a excl trasnfo0rm as a replacement primitive.

#here are the primitive definitions
# 'parents' :           upstream / first generation / replaces column / with offspring
# 'siblings':           upstream / first generation / supplements column / with offspring

#demonstrate here. Further detail on thsi step available in documentation. If you're not sure you might
#want to try just copying an entry in the READ ME.

#and then of course use also has the ability to define their own trasnformation functions to

#And the final bit which I'll just reiterate here is that automunge facilitates the simplest means
#for consistent processing of subsequently available data with just a single function call
#all you need is the postprocess_dict object returned form the original automunge call

#This even works when we passed custom trasnformdict entries as was case with last postprocess_dict
#derived in last example, however if you're defining custom trasfnormation functions for now you
#need to save those custom function definitions are redefine in the new notewbook when applying postmunge

#Here again is a demosntration of postmunge. Since the last postprocess_dict we returned
#was with our custom transfomrations in preceding excample, the 'TransactionAmt' column will
#be processed consistently
